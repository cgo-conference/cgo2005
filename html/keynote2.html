With all major processor 
vendors building multiple processor cores on a single chip, multicores is the 
next tour-de-force in computer architecture. The upside of multicores is 
enormous. The ability to parallelize and execute applications on multiple cores 
provides an opportunity to get the processor performance back on track with the 
Moore's law. However, achieving pervasive and scalable parallelism has been the 
holy grail for many computer scientists from the time of ILLIAC-IV, an illusive dream 
that was never fully realized.</span></font></p>

<span style="font-size:12.0pt;color:black">In this talk I will examine 
how the problem has changed due to the current technology and business factors. 
I will analyze the seismic changes in computer architecture that lead to 
multicores and their impact on compilation. Next, I will review different facets 
of the multicore compiler problem using three case studies - Coarse Grain 
Parallelism from the perspective of the SUIF parallelizing compiler, Instruction 
Level Parallelism with the RAW ILP compiler, and Language Exposed Parallelism 
using the StreamIt language and compiler. Finally, I'll attempt to answer the 
ultimate question: With multicores, can we finally realize the dream that has 
eluded us for so long?</span></font></p>

Saman P. Amarasinghe is an Associate Professor in the Department of
Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at Massachusetts Institute
of Technology and a member of the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science.
He received his BS in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from
Cornell University in 1988, and his MSEE and Ph.D from Stanford
University in 1990 and 1997, respectively. He leads the Commit compiler
group and is the co-leader of the MIT Raw project. Currently he is on
leave from MIT and is the CTO of Determina Corporation, which is
productizing a novel approach against worm attacks that was developed in
his group. His research interests are in discovering novel approaches to
improve the performance of modern computer systems without unduly
increasing the complexity faced by either application developers,
compiler writers, or computer architects.
